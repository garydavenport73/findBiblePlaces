This extension scans text in the current web page to look for a list of known places in the Bible.  If these places are found, they are added to a found list.  

The user can then choose a location from the list and view it on a map of their choice or see the location in Google Maps.

Overall, this extension helps the user reading a web page locate historical locations mentioned in the Bible.

Version 0.0.5 changes are the following:
1) Added a button with the ability to have the map scroll with page (absolute positioning) or fixed in place (fixed).
